    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      If you want the yummy taste of a slowly baked potato but aren't patient
      enough, or don't have the know-how to bake it in an oven, this is for you.
      Give it 12 minutes and get a mouthwatering, taste bud-tingling treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an
      oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. That's why this recipe is
      so darn good - you can have a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a
      little more than 10 minutes! It sounds too good to be true but, we
      promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is.
